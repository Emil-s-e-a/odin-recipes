        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you're making steaks inside, you've come to the right place. This technique for cooking steak in a cast iron skillet is unbeatable. What sets it apart? It starts on the stove in a cast iron skillet, but you'll finish the steak in the oven. The stovetop-to-oven method produces steaks with a deeply caramelized crust and a tender, perfectly cooked interior.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (6 ounce) beef top sirloin steaks</li>
            <li>2 cups orange juice</li>
            <li>1 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>½ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons steak seasoning (such as Fiesta Brand® Uncle Chris'), or to taste</li>
            <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>sea salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1</strong><br>Place steaks side by side in large casserole dish. Add orange juice, cider vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce. Marinate, uncovered, in the refrigerator for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2</strong><br>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3</strong><br>Remove casserole dish from refrigerator. Cover steaks with plastic wrap and let allow to come to room temperature, at least 15 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4</strong><br>Place steaks on a clean work surface and generously rub with steak seasoning and black pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 5</strong>Heat olive oil in a cast-iron skillet over high heat.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 6</strong>Cook steaks in the hot skillet until lightly browned on the bottom, 2 1/2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side and red in the center, about 2 minutes more. Transfer skillet with the steaks to the oven.</li>
            <li><strong>Step7</strong>Bake in the preheated oven until steaks are firm and reddish-pink to lightly pink in the center, 8 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read from 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) to 140 degrees F (60 degrees C).</li>
            <li><strong>Step8</strong>Remove steaks from oven; season with salt. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving.</li>            
        </ol>
